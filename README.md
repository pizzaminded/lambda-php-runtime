# lambda-php-runtime 

Allows to deploy & run your PHP apps in [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) **without** using [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/).

The goal of this project is to make possible to use PHP not only for web requests, but also for all events used within the whole
AWS environment (DynamoDB Streams, S3 Events etc).


Docker required.
